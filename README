The NUOPC-BMI Adapter is part of the Earth Systems Bridge Project.  This project wraps the Basic Modeling Interface (BMI) in a NUOPC Model Component for compatibility within the Earth Systems Modeling Framework.

Runtime linking
See ESMF reference document section 16.4.3 User-code SetServices method for GridComp runtime linking.

=========================
Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.0.0 beta
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - modeladapter_bmi.F90
  - driver.F90  - Driver specializing NUOPC_Driver, driving the single MODEL.
  - mainApp.F90 - Main application cap.

Tested Environment:
  - Linux.gfortran.64.mpich2.default
